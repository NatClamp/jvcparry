      description: 'What This Is. A journey through the belly of the earth, written by nine different authors. You\'ll find great ideas, friends, foes, any maybe a tragic end. This collection of short stories was born from of a quick idea: Hand an author a short sentence about the characters’ location and recent exploits, and let them go wild. In the end, I hoped, something interesting would emerge. While this was true, the original idea changed a bit over the course of the two months it took to assemble the stories. A few strands had to be switched around, and to prevent repetition the last authors needed to clear their idea with me first. However, I tried to stay as true as possible to the original idea. After I finally assembled all the different stories into one journey, the authors were allowed their first look at the contributions. Should you decide to send a group of foolhardy adventurers on this journey, they can start out at level 1. After finishing the 4th Tale, the characters should advance to level 2. All in all, I’d dare to estimate that the journey will take the players 2 or 3 sessions to complete. However, feel free to switch the story around or exchange parts with your own ideas. This collection is certainly more diverse and imaginative than one person alone could hope to create. Even if you’re not playing the stories in the sequence presented, each segment is usable on its own!',
