          I'm a designer, author, and publisher of TTRPG material based in the UK. I'm a freelancer in numerous capacities, but primarily as an author of TTRPG material. Much of my work is for large companies such as LoreSmyth and Nord Games, though I work for private commission too.

          My formal education is in Biosciences and Zoology, and in my spare time I like to play games (obviously), ramble, write, fish, play in bands, and eat fine food!
